    <h1 class="header">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-12-08</p>

    <p>
        MemoAR is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our augmented reality application and associated website.
        By using the app and website, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>App Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
        MemoAR does not collect, store, or process any personal information directly through the app. All content, such as photos and videos, is managed externally via the website,
        which is owned and operated by us. The app itself remains offline, and data stays local to your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The website associated with MemoAR may store data, such as images, videos, or other user-provided content, on our servers. This storage is necessary for the proper functioning
        of the service. Currently, we do not share this data with external providers. However, we reserve the right to use third-party services in the future for data storage or processing,
        such as cloud service providers. Any such change will be reflected in an updated privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Loss and Service Availability</h2>
    <p>
        MemoAR is a proof-of-concept project, and both the app and website are in the initial stages of development. As such, there is a possibility of data loss or deletion during this phase.
        While we take reasonable measures to secure stored data, we cannot guarantee its safety or availability.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibility and Liability Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        By using MemoAR, you agree to the following terms:
        <ul>
            <li>You are solely responsible for ensuring that any images, videos, or other content you upload or use do not violate the rights of others.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for keeping your login credentials, download links, or shared data secure.</li>
            <li>MemoAR and its associated website are not liable for any damages, including but not limited to loss of data or interruption of service.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>No Warranty and Future Changes</h2>
    <p>
        MemoAR and its website are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties. Features, functionality, or policies related to MemoAR may change in the future without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        Under no circumstances will MemoAR, its developers, or its affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the app or website.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to terminate or suspend the app, website, or your access to them at our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including but not limited to violations of this privacy policy or terms of use.
    </p>
